# Welcome to the On-Orbit Collision Predictor! üöÄ

In this project, our team was commissioned by the Canadian Space Agency to develop a predictive system for on-orbit satellite collision risks. This tool helps assess potential orbital collisions using a blend of machine learning and advanced statistical models. The system allows users to input satellite data, calculate collision probabilities, and manage prediction reports. It's designed for space agencies, satellite operators, and researchers to improve decision-making and avoid costly or dangerous on-orbit collisions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** and **Django** for the backend
- **Node.js** and **npm** for the Next.js frontend
- **MATLAB** for initial prediction calculations (optional for extended functionality)
- **PostgreSQL** for database management
- **Supabase** for hosted database setup

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Erik-Cupsa/On-Orbit-Collision-Predictor.git
   cd on-orbit-collision-predictor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - **Backend**: Set up and activate the virtual environment, then install Django and other requirements.

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - **Frontend**: Navigate to the `on-orbit-frontend` folder and install dependencies.

     ```bash
     cd on-orbit-frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Database Setup** (in progress)

   We're using Supabase for this. Configure the database settings in your .env file. Reference the .env.example file if needed.

5. **Run Migrations**

   ```bash
   cd Orbit_Predictor-BackEnd
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
   Database Layout:
   **api_collision**: This table was created from the Collision model. It stores data for collisions related to conjunctions, including information like satellite_id, collision_date,    and risk_factor.

   **api_conjunction**: This table corresponds to the Conjunction model, storing conjunction records that include details like satellite_id, date, risk_factor, and description.

   **api_probabilitycalc**: This table was created from the ProbabilityCalc model. It stores calculated probabilities related to collisions, including fields like probability_value       and time_to_impact.

### Running the Project

To run both the Django backend and the Next.js frontend concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start:
- **Next.js frontend** at `http://localhost:3000`
- **Django backend** at `http://localhost:8000`

## üöÄ Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: App Development
- **User Authentication**: Implement secure login and registration.
- **Basic Prediction Model**: Enable users to input data and generate collision predictions.
- **Admin Panel**: Develop basic admin functionalities.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Improve the collision prediction model using more sophisticated algorithms.
- **Report Management**: Enable detailed reports for users.
- **Notifications**: Add email notifications for high-risk predictions.

### Phase 3: Scalability & Optimization
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure the system performs well under heavy data loads.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement additional security measures.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version of the system for wider accessibility.
